# ProjectMajestic

The collection of all of my Majestic-related projects.  

[Majestic](https://github.com/mehrshad-kh/Majestic) is a cross-platform GUI client written with C++ and Qt.  
[Majestic Admin](https://github.com/mehrshad-kh/MajesticAdmin) is a command-line client for use by admins as it has more privileged access.  
[Majestic Server](https://github.com/mehrshad-kh/MajesticServer) is the server application.  

All apps use gRPC and Protocol Buffers.
